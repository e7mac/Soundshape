Soundshape
==========

Vision
======
Given the physical nature of the iPad, I wanted to make a musical experience that would be as 'plastic' as possible. Doodling and humming seemed like interactions that everyone can do and I wanted to combine them into a music making experience.

Technical Details
==================
Moving to CoreAudio and OpenGL ES in the latest implementation. The backend might remain in Django or might be done in a new server framework that I might wanna learn.

UX
===
The user can start drawing and the sounds that are made while drawing are captured in a "soundshape". A double-tap on any sound starts looping that sound. Scrubbing through the shape causes only those parts of the sound to be played back. These sounds can be uploaded to the server and sounds created by other can be downloaded from the server by clicking on the appropriate buttons. Each sound can also be played back with certain audio effects which are accessed by tapping the shapes
